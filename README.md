From the abve graph it e=vident that the urban city type is at the top when it comes to highest number of rides or top revenue generation. This has transformed into more number of drivers signing up in urban cities. but when we see the avg price per ride its very clear that the rural city types is chargimg more fare per ride or even per driver. That may be due to the factor that the distances atre far and availability of rides and drivers is scarce.

## Recommendations
on the basis of above information we suggest that:
##### 1: Take steps to increase number if rides in Rural Areas
Pyber can improve profits by trying increase the number of rides in Rural Cities. As the avg proce per ride is higher , increase in number of rides in rural areas will increase Pyber's profit
##### 2: Increase Number of Drivers:
The number of drivers in rural and suburban ares is very low. The competition is negligible for drivers and incentives are high. Pyber can use some incentive strategies to increase the numnber of drivers in these city types and generate more business.
#### 3: Fare Adjustment 
Considering the data , the avg fare per driver in urban cities is pretty low and quite high in rural areas. Pyber can try ti improve the gap between this disparity. Pyber can increase a little bit of its fares in urban cities to improve drivers income which can result in increase in number of drivers in urban cities and also try to decrease fares in rural areas that might help in increased revenue by imncreasing number of rides.
